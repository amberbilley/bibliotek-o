# bibliotek-o: a BIBFRAME 2 Extension Ontology

## What is bibliotek-o?

bibliotek-o provides:

* The [bibliotek-o extension ontology](http://bibliotek-o.org/ontology/), which defines additions and modifications to [BIBFRAME 2](http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe), and is intended to be used as a supplement to the core BIBFRAME 2 ontology.
* A set of ontology fragments intended for use with the bibliotek-o extension.
* A set of models and patterns - i.e., an application profile - demonstrating the intended use of the bibliotek-o extension and external terms.

bibliotek-o is a joint product of the Mellon Foundation-funded Linked Data for Libraries - Labs (LD4L - Labs) and Linked Data for Production (LD4P) projects. See the [LD4L website](http://ld4l.org), the [LD4L - Labs public wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=77447730), and the [LD4P public wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=74515029) for more information on these projects.

## Accompanying documentation

Additional documents, currently in progress, will provide: 

  * An overview of the principles and best practices guiding the development of bibliotek-o. 
  * Discussion and diagrams of the principal models and patterns adopted by bibliotek-o. 
  * Narrative presentation of the recommendations in each topic area.
  * Mapping tables from current catalog formats to the ontology recommendation.
  * Application profiles for original data modeling using the bibliotek-o recommendation. 
  
Links to these documents will be added here once they have been published.
