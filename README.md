# Biblioteko: a BIBFRAME 2 Extension Ontology

## What is Biblioteko?

Biblioteko consists of:

* The [Biblioteko extension ontology](http://biblioteko.org/ontology/), which defines additions and modifications to [BIBFRAME 2](http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe), and is intended to be used as a supplement to the core BIBFRAME 2 ontology.
* A set of ontology fragments intended for use with the Biblioteko extension.
* A set of models and patterns - i.e., an application profile - demonstrating the intended use of the Biblioteko and external terms.

Biblioteko is a joint product of the Mellon Foundation-funded Linked Data for Libraries - Labs and Linked Data for Production projects. See <http://ld4l.org> for more information on these projects.

## Repository contents

This repository contains the formal Biblioteko specification, ontology and dataset recommendations for use with Biblioteko (including the recommended BIBFRAME 2 terms), and a set of human-readable documentation. 

  * OWL specification of Biblioteko: `target-ontologies/biblioteko.owl`
  * RDFS and OWL specifications of recommended ontology fragments for use with Biblioteko: `target-ontologies/`
  * Full specifications of these ontologies, for reference purposes: `reference-ontologies/`
  * Datatypes defined by Biblioteko: `xsd/biblioteko-datatypes.xsd`
  * Datasets included in the Biblioteko recommendation: `datasets/`
  * Documentation ([LODE](http://www.essepuntato.it/lode)): `doc/LODE/`
    * An HTML LODE file for each ontology and ontology fragment included in the Biblioteko recommendation.
    * A document listing all the recommended terms, with links out to the specific LODE files.
  
  
## Accompanying documentation

Additional documents, currently in progress, will provide: 

  * An overview of the principles and best practices guiding the development of the ontology. 
  * Discussion and diagrams of the principal models and patterns adopted by Biblioteko. 
  * Narrative presentation of the recommendations in each topic area.
  * Mapping tables from current catalog formats to the ontology recommendation.
  * Application profiles for original data modeling using the Biblioteko recommended ontologies. 
  
Links to these documents will be provided once they have been published.
