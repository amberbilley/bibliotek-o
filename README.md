# LD4L BIBFRAME 2 Extension Ontology

This repository hosts the LD4L BIBFRAME 2 Extension Ontology and supporting reference and target ontologies. The LD4L BIBFRAME 2 Extension ontology fragment includes extensions and modifications to BIBFRAME 2 and is intended to be used as a supplement to the core BIBFRAME 2 ontology. It is a joint product of the Mellon Foundation-funded Linked Data for Libraries - Labs and Linked Data for Production projects. See <http://ld4l.org> for more information on these projects.
