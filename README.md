# biblioteko: a BIBFRAME 2 Extension Ontology

## What is biblioteko?

biblioteko consists of:

* The [bibliotek-o extension ontology](http://bibliotek-o.org/ontology/), which defines additions and modifications to [BIBFRAME 2](http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe), and is intended to be used as a supplement to the core BIBFRAME 2 ontology.
* A set of ontology fragments intended for use with the bibliotek-o extension.
* A set of models and patterns - i.e., an application profile - demonstrating the intended use of the bibliotek-o extension and external terms.

biblioteko is a joint product of the Mellon Foundation-funded Linked Data for Libraries - Labs and Linked Data for Production projects. See <http://ld4l.org> for more information on these projects.

## Repository contents

This repository contains the formal bibliotek-o specification, ontology and dataset recommendations for use with bibliotek-o (including the recommended BIBFRAME 2 terms), and a set of human-readable documentation. 

  * OWL specification of bibliotek-o: `target-ontologies/bibliotek-o.owl`
  * RDFS and OWL specifications of recommended ontology fragments for use with bibliotek-o: `target-ontologies/`
  * Full specifications of these ontologies, for reference purposes: `reference-ontologies/`
  * Datatypes defined by biblioteko: `xsd/biblioteko-datatypes.xsd`
  * Datasets included in the biblioteko recommendation: `datasets/`
  * Documentation ([LODE](http://www.essepuntato.it/lode)): `doc/LODE/`
    * An HTML LODE file for each ontology and ontology fragment included in the biblioteko recommendation.
    * A document listing all the recommended terms, with links out to the specific LODE files.
  
  
## Accompanying documentation

Additional documents, currently in progress, will provide: 

  * An overview of the principles and best practices guiding the development of the ontology. 
  * Discussion and diagrams of the principal models and patterns adopted by biblioteko. 
  * Narrative presentation of the recommendations in each topic area.
  * Mapping tables from current catalog formats to the ontology recommendation.
  * Application profiles for original data modeling using the biblioteko recommended ontologies. 
  
Links to these documents will be provided once they have been published.
