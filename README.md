# BibX: a BIBFRAME 2 extension

The [BibX ontology extension](http://bibx.org/ontology/) defines additions and modifications to [BIBFRAME 2](http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe), and is intended to be used as a supplement to the core BIBFRAME 2 ontology. It is a joint product of the Mellon Foundation-funded Linked Data for Libraries - Labs and Linked Data for Production projects. See <http://ld4l.org> for more information on these projects.

This repository contains the formal BibX specification, along with ontology and dataset recommendations for use with BibX (including the recommended BIBFRAME 2 terms), and human-readable documentation. 

## Repository contents:

  * OWL specification of BibX: `target-ontologies/bibx.owl`
  * RDFS and OWL specifications of recommended ontology fragments for use with BibX: `target-ontologies/`
  * Full specifications of these ontologies, for reference purposes: `reference-ontologies/`
  * Datatypes defined by BibX: `xsd/bibx-datatypes.xsd`
  * Datasets included in the BibX recommendation: `datasets/`
  * Documentation ([LODE](http://www.essepuntato.it/lode)): `doc/LODE/`
